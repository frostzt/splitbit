# Load Balancer Implementation Todo List

## Phase 1: Basic Forwarding
- [x] **Define Backend Server Pool**
  - Create a struct to represent backend servers (host, port, alive status)
  - Maintain a list/slice of available backend servers
  - Add configuration for backend servers (hardcoded first, then config file)

- [x] **Implement Request Forwarding**
  - Instead of responding directly, forward client requests to backend servers
  - Establish connection to selected backend server
  - Copy data bidirectionally between client and backend (io.Copy or custom proxy)
  - Handle connection cleanup for both client and backend connections

- [x] **Basic Round Robin Algorithm**
  - Keep track of current server index
  - Rotate through servers sequentially
  - Handle wraparound when reaching end of server list

## Phase 2: Load Balancing Algorithms
- [x] **Weighted Round Robin**
  - Add weight field to backend server struct
  - Implement weighted selection logic
  - Allow different servers to handle different loads

- [ ] **Least Connections**
  - Track active connection count per backend server
  - Select server with fewest active connections
  - Update connection counts on connect/disconnect

- [ ] **Random Selection**
  - Implement random backend server selection
  - Add weighted random option

- [ ] **IP Hash / Consistent Hashing**
  - Hash client IP to determine backend server
  - Ensures same client always goes to same server (session affinity)
  - Implement consistent hashing for better distribution

## Phase 3: Health Checking
- [ ] **Active Health Checks**
  - Implement periodic health check pings to backend servers
  - Mark servers as healthy/unhealthy based on response
  - Remove unhealthy servers from rotation automatically
  - Add configurable health check intervals and timeouts

- [ ] **Passive Health Checks**
  - Monitor connection failures during normal operation
  - Temporarily remove servers that fail multiple requests
  - Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing servers

- [ ] **Health Check Endpoints**
  - Define custom health check URLs for HTTP backends
  - Support different health check methods (TCP, HTTP, custom)

## Phase 4: Connection Management
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**
  - Maintain pools of persistent connections to backend servers
  - Reuse connections instead of creating new ones for each request
  - Implement connection pool sizing and cleanup

- [ ] **Connection Limits**
  - Set maximum concurrent connections per backend server
  - Implement queue system for excess connections
  - Add connection throttling and rate limiting

- [ ] **Timeout Management**
  - Configure connection timeouts, read timeouts, write timeouts
  - Handle slow backends gracefully
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

## Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] **SSL/TLS Support**
  - Add TLS termination at load balancer
  - Support SSL passthrough mode
  - Certificate management and rotation

- [ ] **Session Persistence**
  - Implement sticky sessions (session affinity)
  - Support cookie-based session routing
  - Handle session failover scenarios

- [ ] **HTTP-Specific Features** (if building HTTP load balancer)
  - Parse HTTP headers for advanced routing
  - Support path-based routing
  - Header manipulation and injection
  - Gzip compression support

## Phase 6: Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] **Metrics Collection**
  - Track requests per second, response times, error rates
  - Monitor backend server performance metrics
  - Connection pool statistics

- [ ] **Logging**
  - Structured logging with different log levels
  - Request/response logging with correlation IDs
  - Access logs in standard formats

- [ ] **Health Dashboard**
  - Web interface showing backend server status
  - Real-time metrics display
  - Manual server enable/disable controls

## Phase 7: Configuration and Deployment
- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - YAML/JSON configuration files
  - Runtime configuration reloading without restart
  - Environment variable support
  - Command-line argument parsing

- [ ] **Graceful Shutdown**
  - Handle SIGTERM/SIGINT signals properly
  - Drain existing connections before shutdown
  - Prevent accepting new connections during shutdown

- [ ] **Docker Support**
  - Create Dockerfile for containerized deployment
  - Docker Compose setup with sample backend servers
  - Health check integration

## Phase 8: Performance and Scalability
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Profile CPU and memory usage
  - Optimize goroutine usage and pooling
  - Implement efficient data structures for server selection

- [ ] **High Availability**
  - Support multiple load balancer instances
  - Leader election for configuration management
  - State synchronization between instances

- [ ] **Auto-scaling Integration**
  - Dynamic backend server discovery
  - Integration with service discovery systems (Consul, etcd)
  - Kubernetes integration

## Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Unit Tests**
  - Test load balancing algorithms
  - Test health checking logic
  - Mock backend servers for testing

- [ ] **Integration Tests**
  - End-to-end testing with real backend servers
  - Failure scenario testing
  - Load testing with various traffic patterns

- [ ] **Benchmarking**
  - Performance comparisons with other load balancers
  - Latency and throughput measurements
  - Resource usage analysis
