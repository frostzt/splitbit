# Splitbit

An extremely simple and lightweight proxy written in GoLang. Splitbit is still being built and more features are being
added, please check the TODO file for what's to come.

## How to run?

Since the project is fairly new and is being updated frequently, you can build it easily with `go build` or use the
provided `Makefile`. You can also run this directly using `make run` in the root directory.
